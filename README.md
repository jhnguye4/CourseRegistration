# Course Registration
This project is a course registration system for a university, similar to the system in MyPackPortal that students use to register for courses at North Carolina State University. This project implements a system that provides functionality for admitted students to register for courses that are taught by faculty. The courses will have enrollment caps and waitlists. To gain access to the gui, the user name will be registrar and the password is Registr@r.
